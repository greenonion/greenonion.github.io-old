## Section 1.2

### Section 1.2.1

#### Exercise 1.9

First procedure:

{% highlight scheme %}
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
{% endhighlight %}

Second procedure:

{% highlight scheme %}
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8
(+ 0 9)
9
{% endhighlight %}

The first process is a linear recursive process.
The second process is a linear iterative process.

Hint: try to see whether calling itself is _absolutely_ the last thing a
procedure does.

#### Exercise 1.10

Expression `(A 1 10)`:

{% highlight scheme %}
(A 1 10)
(A 0
   (A 1 9))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 1 8
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 1 7))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 1 6)))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 0
               (A 1 5))))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 0
               (A 0
                  (A 1 4)))))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 0
               (A 0
                  (A 0
                     (A 1 3))))))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 0
               (A 0
                  (A 0
                     (A 0
                        (A 1 2)))))))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 0
               (A 0
                  (A 0
                     (A 0
                        (A 0
                           (A 1 1))))))))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 0
               (A 0
                  (A 0
                     (A 0
                        (A 0 2)))))))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 0
               (A 0
                  (A 0
                     (A 0 4))))))))
 (A 0
    (A 0
       (A 0
          (A 0
             (A 0
                (A 0
                   (A 0 8)))))))
 (A 0
    (A 0
       (A 0
          (A 0
             (A 0
                (A 0 16))))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0
            (A 0 32)))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0
         (A 0 64))))
(A 0
   (A 0
      (A 0 128)))
(A 0
   (A 0 256))
(A 0 512)
1024
{% endhighlight %}

So `(A 1 x)` is \\(2^x\\).

Expression `(A 2 4)`|:

{% highlight scheme %}
(A 2 4)
(A 1
   (A 2 3))
;; So this is 2^(A 2 3), let's see
(A 2 3)
(A 1
   (A 2 2))
;; So 2^(2^(A 2 2))
(A 2 2)
(A 1
   (A 2 1))
;; So 2^(2^(2^(A 2 1)))
(A 2 1)
2
;; So finally 2^(2^(2^2))
;; Or 2^(2^4)
;; Or 2^16
;; 65,636
{% endhighlight %}

So `(A 2 x)` is 2 to the power of 2, to the power of 2 .. `x` times.

Expression `(A 3 3)`:

{% highlight scheme %}
(A 3 3)
(A 2
   (A 3 2))
;; We know what (A 2 x) is, 2 to the power of 2 x times.
;; Let's see where (A 3 2) takes us:
(A 3 2)
(A 2
   (A 3 1))
(A 2 2)
;; Which is 2^2
;; and the starting expression is (A 2 4)
;; Which is exactly the same as before.
{% endhighlight %}

So again `(A 3 3)` equals \\(2^{16} = 65,636\\).

-  `(f n)` computes \\(2n\\).
-  `(g n)` computes \\(2^n\\).
-  `(h n)` computes 2 to the power of 2, to the power of 2 .. `x` times.

### Section 1.2.2

#### Exercise 1.11

Recursive process:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (f n)
  (if (< n 3)
      n
      (+ (f (- n 1))
         (* 2 (f (- n 2)))
         (* 3 (f (- n 3))))))

(f 4)
{% endhighlight %}

Iterative process:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (f n)
  (if (< n 3)
      n
      (f-iter 2 1 0 (- n 2))))

(define (f-iter a b c count)
  (if (= count 0)
      a
      (f-iter (+ a (* 2 b) (* 3 c)) a b (- count 1))))

(f 4)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Exercise 1.12

We define a procedure `pascal` that accepts a row and a column as arguments:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (pascal x y)
  (if (or (= y 0) (= x y))
      1
      (+ (pascal (- x 1) (- y 1))
         (pascal (- x 1) y))))

(pascal 3 2)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Exercise 1.13
First, the induction.

The base step, for $$n = 0$$:

$$\mathrm{Fib}(0) = (\phi^0 - \psi^0) / \sqrt{5} = 0 \textrm{, it holds.}$$

Assume it is true for $$n$$, we will prove that it is true for $$n + 1$$:

$$
\begin{align*}

\mathrm{Fib}(n+1) &= \frac{\phi^{n+1} - \psi^{n+1}}{\sqrt{5}}\\
\frac{\phi^{n+1} - \psi^{n+1}}{\sqrt{5}} &= \mathrm{Fib}(n) + \mathrm{Fib}(n - 1)\\
\frac{\phi^{n+1} - \psi^{n+1}}{\sqrt{5}} &= \frac{\phi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5}} +
\frac{\phi^{n-1} - \psi^{n-1}}{\sqrt{5}}\\
\phi^{n+1} - \psi^{n+1} &= \phi^n - \psi^n + \phi^{n-1} - \psi^{n-1}\\
\phi^{n-1}(\phi^2 - \phi - 1) &= \psi^{n-1}(\psi^2 - \psi - 1)

\end{align*}
$$

By definition, $$\phi^2 = \phi + 1$$. Notice that also $$\psi^2 = \psi + 1$$. This
means that both sides of the equation are $0$, and the induction holds.

We have proven that

$$
\begin{equation*}

\mathrm{Fib}(n) = \frac{\phi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5}}

\end{equation*}
$$

Now we need to prove that $$\vert\frac{\psi^n}{\sqrt{5}}\vert < \frac{1}{2}$$.

Notice that $$\psi < \frac{1}{2}$$, and hence $$\vert\psi^{n+1}\vert < \vert\psi^n\vert, \forall n \in N$$.
Since $$\vert\frac{\psi^0}{\sqrt{5}}\vert < \frac{1}{2}$$, it holds for all the rest values
of $$n$$.
