title: "Year 2017 - A Retrospective"
---

I've been meaning to do a retrospective of sorts for the past few years, each
time I postponed it until it made no sense any more. Here goes.

2017 was a rough year for me. On the upside:

* I got to visit America for the first time.
* I visited Barcelona for the excellent Curry On conference.
* I read a whole bunch of books.
* I listened to a whole lot of music and at last managed to do some music
  rehearsals once again.
* I started the [Athenian chapter of Papers We
  Love](https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Athens/) with a friend.
* We co-organised the [Athens Clojure
  meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Athens-Clojure-Meetup/).
* I played board games weekly.
* I started excercising regurarly and became more strict about my bedtime. This
  has possibly been the most important thing I did for myself in 2017.
* I started writing some posts here.

## Best articles and blog posts I read

Thanks to [pinboard](https://pinboard.in) I can easily look back on articles and
blog posts I read in 2017.

* [The 50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/9948-the-50-best-ambient-albums-of-all-time/)
  I've been using this list whenever I want something good to listen to while I
  work or study.
* [Book Review: Eichmann in
  Jerusalem](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/30/book-review-eichmann-in-jerusalem/)
  _by Scott Alexander_.
  I don't always like Alexander's style, but his commentary here as well as the
  parts quoted from the book made me order it instantly.
* [How we structure our work and teams at
  Basecamp](https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-set-up-our-work-cbce3d3d9cae) _by
  Jason Fried_.
  Fried clearly knows what he's talking about, and I enjoy how he and DHH go
  against the normal SV ethos of working yourself to death. We tried both 6-week
  cycles and 4-day summertime weeks at [work](www.skroutz.gr) with (I believe)
  great success.
* [Reflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At
  Uber](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber)
  _by Susan Fowler_.
  I don't think I need to say much here. Before the Weinstein scandal broke out,
  we found out how terrible the culture at Uber was.
* [Recipe for a Great
  Programmer](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/recipe-for-a-great-programmer.html) _by
  Nathan Martz_.
  Martz's advice is concise and to the point.
* [The world beyond batch: Streaming
  101](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101) _by
  Tyler Akidau_.
  Whenever someone asks me about streaming systems, I recommend they read this
  blogpost and its
  [followup](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102).
  Akidau first defines the problem, then the old solutions, and finally gives a
  very nice description of how the Dataflow model works.
* [So You Want to Be a Wizard](https://jvns.ca/blog/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard/)
  _by Julia Evans_.
  In the same as Nathan Martz's post, Julia Evans gives a really inspiring
  description of what it takes to be a truly great software engineer.
* [Reversing the Technical
  Interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/340-acing-the-technical-interview) _by Kyle
  Kingsbury_.
  The amazing Kyle Kingsbury (of Jepsen fame) destroys the whole concept of a
  technical whiteboard interview with this hilarious post.
* [Once We Listened to the Beatles. Now We Eat
  Beetles.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-28/once-we-listened-to-the-beatles-now-we-eat-beetles)
  _by Tyler Cowen_.
  I didn't find the time to read Cowen's book [The Complacent
  Class](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939212-the-complacent-class), but
  this article gives the gist of his thinking. I think his arguments about
  complacency are relevant not only to America, but to the western world in
  general.
* [Inside the High Tech Hunt for a Missing Silicon Valley
  Legend](https://www.wired.com/2007/07/ff-jimgray-2/?currentPage=all) _by Steve
  Silberman._
  It's now been more than 10 years since Jim Gray disappeared without trace.
  This is an old but really excellent article describing how the tech world
  mobilized in an effort to track him down. Gray's contributions to computer
  science cannot be overstated, but this story would be amazing either way.
* [#define
  CTO](https://blog.gregbrockman.com/figuring-out-the-cto-role-at-stripe) _by
  Greg Brockman._
  This blog post has really influenced my thought on how the engineering branch
  of a tech company should be structured.
* [When the Revolution Came for Amy  Cuddy](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html?_r=0)
  _by Susan Dominus._
  I've spent part of the later half of 2017 thinking about experiments,
  validation, statistical significance, and repeatability. Then the New York
  Times published an article describing the crisis that has hit behavioral
  sciences the past few years. Not even Kahneman was immune.

## Favorite non-technical books I read

I read 32 books in 2017, 5 more than in 2016. I hope that in 2018 I read more
than 40.

* [The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the
  World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2006163.The_Beginning_of_Infinity)
  _by David Deutsch._
  This was, by far, the most influential book I read all year. Deutsch discusses
  the philosophy of science, creativity, quantum physics, evolution, politics,
  and art, unified under his theory of optimism and fallibilism. Problems are
  inevitable, problems are soluble.
* [The Method: A Personal Account of the Tortures in
  Greece](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24764075) _by Periclis
  Korovesis._
  A really important memoir of the brutality of the Greek military junta (1967 -
  1974).
* [The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing
  Personal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/722412.The_Dream_Machine) _by M.
  Mitchell Waldrop_.
  A truly inspiring description of the history of the personal computer,
  starting from Turing and going all the way through MIT and ARPA to XEROX PARC
  and Apple. A shame it is not in print any more.
* [The Third Wedding](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8615868) _by Costas
  Taktsis_.
  A truly suffocating description of lower middle class families in Greece
  during the early 20th century. Possibly one of the greatest novels ever
  written in greek.
* [Outliers: The Story of
  Success](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers) _by Malcolm
  Gladwell_.
  While I do think that Gladwell tends to oversimplify things a bit so he can
  fit them under his theory, this is a book full of good stories, and Gladwell
  is one of the greatest storytellers alive.
* [High Output
  Management](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27208527-high-output-management)
  _by Andy Grove_.
  This small book helped me a lot on how to think about management, and how we
  tend to underestimate its importance.

## Favorite technical books I almost read

I spent a good chunk of 2017 studying [Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43713.Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs).
Then I put it on pause to start reading [Designing Data-Intensive
Applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications).
Both have helped and influenced me massively, and I do look forward to finishing
them in 2018.

* __Hüsker Dü - their discography__. This was the soundtrack of my 2017.

  NYC.

  is huge!
* Organizing monthly Papers We Love meetups.
