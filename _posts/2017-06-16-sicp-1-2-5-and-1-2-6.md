### Section 1.2.5 - Greatest Common Divisors

#### Exercise 1.20

The difference between applicative and normal order is that applicative first
evaluates the arguments and then applies the procedure. In contrast, normal
order first expands the procedure and then reduces it. Also note that `if` is a
special form, where which (and whether) procedure is evaluated depends on the
predicate.

Let's first see the applicative order:

{% highlight scheme %}
(gcd 206 40) ;; apply if, second branch produces
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40)) ;; remember, we evaluate arguments first
(gcd 40 6)
(gcd 40 (remainder 40 6)) ;; 2nd time we need remainder
(gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 (remainder 4 6)) ;; 3rd time
(gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 (remainder 4 2)) ;; 4th time
(gcd 2 0) ;; the predicate is true
2
{% endhighlight %}

In the normal order, we first expand and then apply only as needed. So:

{% highlight scheme %}
(gcd 206 40) ;; apply if, second branch produces
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40)) ;; the if will be as follows
;; apply gcd
(if (= (remainder 206 40) 0) ;; this gets evaluated, so 1 call
    40
    (gcd (remainder 206 40)
         (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))
;; apply gcd
(if (= (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) 0) ;; 2 calls
    (remainder 206 40)
    (gcd (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
         (remainder
           (remainder 206 40
             (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))))
;; apply gcd
(if (= (rem (rem 206 40) (rem 40 (rem 206 40))) 0) ;; 4 calls
    (rem 40 (rem 206 40))
    (gcd (rem (rem 206 40) (rem 40 (rem 206 40)))
         (rem
           (rem 40 (rem 206 40))
           (rem (rem 206 40) (rem 40 (rem 206 40))))))
;; apply gcd
;; this time the predicate will be b from the previous
;; iteration which contains 7 calls to remainder but
;; evaluates to 0 so we evaluate a from the previous
;; iteration (4 calls to remainder) and we are done.
{% endhighlight %}

So in summary, the normal order will need:
$$1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 4 = 18$$ calls to `remainder`.

### Section 1.2.6 - Example: Testing for Primality

#### Exercise 1.21

{% highlight scheme %}
> (smallest-divisor 199)
199
> (smallest-divisor 1999)
1999
> (smallest-divisor 19999)
7
{% endhighlight %}

So while $$199$$ and $$1999$$ are primes, $$19999$$ is not.

#### Exercise 1.22

$$\sqrt{10} = 3.17$$. This means that we expect time to roughly triple between
orders of magnitude. Our results are:

{% highlight scheme %}
;; Greater than 1,000
;; 1009 *** 3
;; 1013 *** 2
;; 1019 *** 2
;; Greater than 10,000
;; 10007 *** 6
;; 10009 *** 6
;; 10037 *** 6
;; Greater than 100,000
;; 100003 *** 17
;; 100019 *** 18
;; 100043 *** 18
;; Greater than 1,000,000
;; 1000003 *** 59
;; 1000033 *** 59
;; 1000037 *** 59
{% endhighlight %}

The results roughly confirm our calculations. We wouldn't expect exact results
since the actual timing depends on a lot of things.

#### Exercise 1.23

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (next n)
  (if (= n 2)
      3
      (+ n 2)))
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %}
;; 1009 *** 6
;; 1013 *** 6
;; 1019 *** 6
;; 10007 *** 9
;; 10009 *** 8
;; 10037 *** 8
;; 100003 *** 16
;; 100019 *** 15
;; 100043 *** 16
;; 1000003 *** 41
;; 1000033 *** 40
;; 1000037 *** 40
{% endhighlight %}

Essentially the steps taken by the algorithm will now be limited by
$\sqrt{n}/2$. This means that $\sqrt{n}$ will still dominate the algorithm, but
given a large-enough input the time will be roughly halved.

#### Exercise 1.24

{% highlight scheme %}
;; 1009 *** 13
;; 1013 *** 13
;; 1019 *** 13
;; 10007 *** 15
;; 10009 *** 14
;; 10037 *** 14
;; 100003 *** 21
;; 100019 *** 16
;; 100043 *** 16
;; 1000003 *** 17
;; 1000033 *** 18
;; 1000037 *** 19
{% endhighlight %}

We would expect the time to test primes near $1,000,000$ to be roughly the
triple of the time to test primes near $1,000$. We do not obseve even that kind
of change, probably due to fast hardware, but we do observe that the runtime
grows very slowly.

#### Exercise 1.25

While conceptually Alyssa is correct, in practice the call to `fast-expt` will
result in dealing with big numbers, and trying to find their `remainder`. Our
`expmod` method will always find the remainder of small numbers, multiply them
together, find their remainder, etc. See footnote 46. Bear in mind also that
primality checks are usually done for very large numbers.

The results are pretty grave in practice:

{% highlight scheme %}
;; 1009 *** 92
;; 1013 *** 102
;; 1019 *** 83
;; 10007 *** 3071
;; 10009 *** 3192
;; 10037 *** 2880
{% endhighlight %}

#### Exercise 1.26

By rewriting the `expmod` procedure to use explicit multiplication, Louis has
changed it into a tree recursive process from a linear one. This means that in
each steps two subtrees will be created, and the amount of calls grow
exponentially. So $$2^{\log n} = n$$.

#### Exercise 1.27

We create a procedure `congruent?` as such:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (congruent? n)
  (congruent-iter n 0))

(define (congruent-iter n a)
  (cond ((= a n) true)
        ((= (expmod a n n) a) (congruent-iter n (+ a 1)))
        (else false)))
{% endhighlight %}

Calling the procedure for the Carmichael numbers of footnote 47 (561, 1105,
1729, 2465, 2821 and 6601) we always get `#t`. The `fast-prime?` procedure would
be fooled. However, we can use the `prime?` procedure to confirm that these
numbers are not primes.

#### Exercise 1.28

First we create the function that performs the check and short-circuits the
computation:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (miller-rabin-check a m)
  (if (and (not (= a 1))
           (not (= a (- m 1)))
           (= (remainder (square a) m) 1))
      0
      a))
{% endhighlight %}

We want to use the above before squaring the result of each iteration. Since we
cannot store variables yet, what we can do is wrap the `expmod` call to itself
inside a `miller-rabin-check` call. `miller-rabin-check` will get the result of
the previous iteration as input, and check whether it is a non-trivial square
root of 1. If it is, it will return 0, essentially short-circuting the result.
If it is not, it will return the result, thus letting `expmod` continue as
usual.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (miller-rabin-expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder
          (square
           (miller-rabin-check
            (miller-rabin-expmod base (/ exp 2) m) m)) m))
        (else
         (remainder (* base
          (miller-rabin-expmod base (- exp 1) m))
          m))))
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we can run the check for half the size of the input to make sure we
produce the correct answer:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (miller-rabin-test n)
  (define (try-it a)
    (= (miller-rabin-expmod a (- n 1) n) 1))
  (try-it (+ 1 (random (- n 1)))))

(define (miller-rabin-prime? n)
  (define (test-prime times)
    (cond ((<= times 0) true)
          ((miller-rabin-test n) (test-prime (- times 1)))
          (else false)))
  (test-prime (/ n 2)))
{% endhighlight %}

We can use both the prime numbers we found and the Carmichael numbers to confirm
that our new procedure always produces the correct result and is not fooled.
